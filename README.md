# Kali Scripts

## Overview
This is simply a place for me to store scripts to make my life easier using kali.  Hopfully others will find them useful and even contribute to them.

### kaliupdate.sh
This is a simple update script, I purposfully kept it simple and easy to read with a lot of echo's to the screen so people newer to shell scripting could understand it and easily update it adding the tools they want to keep updated.  Simply it:

1. Updates the system
2. Updates a few tools I use often enough to want to keep up to date.

I didn't automate adding in bleeding edge packages.  I'm going to wait and see how that goes first.  But this is a lot less than the backtrack update script I wrote.  Kali is doing a good job keeping things updated often in packages, no need to do more.

I hope someone out there finds it useful to see and I hope people contribute back and I would love to see what tools other people like.
